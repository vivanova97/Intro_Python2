"""Problem 5: Fraction Class
Objective: Create a class called Fraction to represent rational numbers with the following features:

Implement __init__ to initialize the fraction and reduce it to its simplest form.
Implement __add__ to add two fractions.
Implement __sub__ to subtract two fractions.
Implement __mul__ to multiply two fractions.
Implement __truediv__ to divide two fractions.
Implement __eq__ to compare two fractions.
Implement __lt__, __le__, __gt__, and __ge__ to compare fractions.
Use __setattr__ to restrict numerator and denominator to integers and the denominator to non-zero values.
Use __delattr__ to prevent modifying the numerator and denominator after initialization."""
